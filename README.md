veritinder
==========

CS50 final project

The code for VeriTinder, a match-making website. Users enter up to three secret crushes as well as times that they are available. If a user's crush has entered the user as one of their crushes, both users are notified of the match through email, where a blind date (the users don't know which of their three crushes they have matched with) is set up between the users, with a time, date, and location for the date.
